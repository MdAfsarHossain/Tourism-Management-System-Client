# [Tourism Management Spot](https://tourista-hub.web.app/)

The `Tourism Management Spot` is a user-friendly web application for tourists to explore and share famous places worldwide. Users can log in to `view detailed` information about tourist spots, `add` their own spots with descriptions, and `manage` them by `updating` or `deleting` entries. They can also `review` and `rate` places added by others, but not their own, ensuring fairness. Reviews can be `edited` or `removed` by the reviewer. The site is `fully responsive`, offering smooth access on `mobile`, `tablet`, and `desktop`. Future updates will include an interactive map to showcase tourist spots. Built with a robust technology stack, the platform ensures excellent performance and scalability.
